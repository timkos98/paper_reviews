**Summary:**

**Background and Motivation:**

- Studying proteins is essential for understanding biological processes and diseases, but analyzing large biomolecules can be challenging.
- Mass spectrometry is a valuable technique for protein analysis, but traditional ionization methods can cause protein unfolding and denaturation.

**Principles of Nonresonant Femtosecond Laser Vaporization:**

- The study begins by introducing the concept of nonresonant femtosecond laser vaporization, which involves using ultrashort laser pulses to create highly energetic and nonthermal conditions for ionization.
- Unlike traditional ionization methods, this approach aims to minimize protein denaturation and retain the native folded structure in the gas-phase.

**Experimental Methodology:**

- The authors describe the experimental setup, which includes a femtosecond laser system and a mass spectrometer.
- Aqueous protein samples are introduced into the system, and femtosecond laser pulses are used to ionize the proteins in the gas-phase.

**Key Findings:**

- The research demonstrates that nonresonant femtosecond laser vaporization preserves the folded structure of aqueous proteins during ionization.
- Mass spectrometry analysis of the ionized proteins reveals that their native structure is retained in the gas-phase, allowing for more accurate structural information to be obtained.
- The technique is shown to be effective for a range of protein sizes and types, highlighting its versatility.

**Significance:**

- The article underscores the significance of nonresonant femtosecond laser vaporization as a breakthrough in preserving the native structure of proteins during ionization.
- This approach has important implications for structural biology and proteomics, where maintaining protein conformation is crucial for meaningful analysis.

**Applications:**

- Brady et al. discuss potential applications of this technique in various fields, including the study of protein-ligand interactions, protein folding dynamics, and the analysis of large and complex protein assemblies.
- The ability to study proteins in their native state in the gas-phase offers new opportunities for understanding biological processes at the molecular level.

**Future Directions:**

- The authors suggest that future research could focus on optimizing and expanding the application of nonresonant femtosecond laser vaporization for a wider range of biomolecules and analytical challenges.
- Integration with other mass spectrometry techniques and instrumentation is also considered as a promising avenue for further advancement.
